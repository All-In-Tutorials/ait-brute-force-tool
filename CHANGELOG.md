# ðŸ“Œ CHANGELOG

## ðŸ”¥ Latest Improvements (Development)

### âœ… Better Logging
- Uses `logging.info()` instead of `print()`, making debugging easier.

### âœ… More Reliable Exception Handling
- Catches `TimeoutException`, `NoSuchElementException`, and generic errors for robustness.

### âœ… No Unnecessary Sleep Delays
- Uses `wait.until(...)` instead of `time.sleep()` for efficient execution.

### âœ… Handles Wrong Login Page More Efficiently
- Detects and avoids unnecessary page reloads when redirected to the wrong login page.

### âœ… CLI Arguments for Automation

- Run the tool with custom login URLs:
  
  ```sh
  python main.py --login_url "http://example.com/login" --wrong_url "http://example.com/fail"
  ```
