## üìå Usage

### Running the Generator (generator.py)

- The generator creates possible (A-Z) and (1-9) combinations based on predefined rules.

```sh
python generator.py
```

- It will automatically generate possible combinations based on selected option (1-14).
- Option 15 will automatically execute all options from 1 to 14 (choose this option if you want to generate all).
- **This script also generates a `prefix.txt` file, which is required for testing.** Ensure this file **exists** and contains a **hardcoded value for the exact username prefix** after execution.

### Running the Brute Force Tool (main.py)

To start the tool, run:

```sh
python main.py
```
or

```sh
python3 main.py
```

### Running with CLI Arguments

- Run the tool with custom login/dashboard URLs:
  
  ```sh
  python main.py --login_url "http://example.com/login" --wrong_url "http://example.com/fail"
  ```

## üî¢ Mapping Rules

### Overview
This document outlines the mapping rules for username and password combinations. There are two levels of mapping: **Basic Level** and **Advanced Level**.

### Basic Level Mapping
In this level, each username maps to an identical password.

```
1  -> 1
2  -> 2
3  -> 3
...
14 -> 14
```

### Advanced Level Mapping
In this level, each username maps to multiple possible passwords, except for its identical match.

```
1  -> 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 14
2  -> 1, 3, 4, 5, ..., 14
...
14 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 13
```

### How to Use
- **Basic Level Mapping**: Use when a direct one-to-one mapping is required.
- **Advanced Level Mapping**: Use when multiple mappings are needed for increased flexibility.

### Notes
- Ensure that the correct mapping level is selected before execution.
- Future updates may introduce additional mapping rules or customization options.

## üîß Troubleshooting  

### ‚ùå ChromeDriver Version Mismatch  
If you encounter an error like:  

> This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version X  

Check that:  
- Your ChromeDriver version matches your **Chrome browser version**.  
- Your Chrome is up to date, or downgrade Chrome to match the driver.  

### ‚ùå Python Not Found  
If you see **"command not found"**, ensure **Python is installed and added to your system PATH**.  

### ‚ùå Selenium Import Error  
If you see **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'selenium'**, reinstall Selenium:  

```sh
pip install selenium --upgrade
```
